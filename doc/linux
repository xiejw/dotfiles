2020-07-02 docker on centos 8

  Centos 8 recommended podman over docker. So official support is not available.
  The containerd.io version is blocked at the moment. The workaround is blocking
  the bad versions as

      exclude=docker-ce-3:19* docker-ce-3:18.09.[2-9]*

  So the system is not confused.
